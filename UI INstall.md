OS undetected on Distro suppose to work
If you get the message [ ERROR ] Unable to detect os and CONTINUE_ON_UNDETECTED_OS is set to false on a system that is suppose to work fine,
Make sure the command awk '/^ID=/' /etc/*-release | awk -F'=' '{ print tolower($2) }' returns only one line containing the distro name (e.g debian, ubuntu etc...).
If not, it might be caused by an other release file in /etc such as /etc/cloud-release.

As a quick fix you can force the script to only look at /etc/os-release instead of /etc/*-release.

1. Download the script

curl -s https://github.com/Coleganet/wireguard_PI-/raw/master/UI-install.sh -O UI-install.sh
2. Modify the script (Line 28) with vim, nano or whatever editor you like.

From:

OS_DETECTED="$(awk '/^ID=/' /etc/*-release | awk -F'=' '{ print tolower($2) }')"
To

OS_DETECTED="$(awk '/^ID=/' /etc/os-release | awk -F'=' '{ print tolower($2) }')"
3. Run the script

bash install.sh
